# Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing
# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:

# 1.   Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
# 2.   Extracts the first five elements from the list.
# 3.   Reverses these extracted elements.
# 4.   Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list

number_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
print("Original list:", list)
first_five = number_list[:5]
print("Extract first five elements:", first_five)
print("Reversed Extract first five elements:", first_five[::-1])
